## Why this project

Starting interacting with DeFi protocols, I wanted to create a strategy and what is the best way to monitore on-chain activity except creating our own tools. Especially I wanted to focus on CLMM (Concentrated Liquidity Market Making) strategies. And as time goes and new solutions appear to us, I needed to get a quick view on my LP (liquidity providing) portfolio to be able to measure important metrics. 
This have double benefits: first is to get a better understanding of the key components of CLMM and act practively on my strategy depending on the market conditions.
Deepening such DeFi protocls made me realize that risk is more important than performance. The idea is to optimize our risk/return. Controlling our loss ensure a major part of our global startegy. 

**What’s now:**

Entering a LP position we can find relevant informations such as:
-	TVL
-	Estimated APY
-	Positions
-	Token balance

This is a good start to assess the pool performance.
But we also need to monitore the risk metrics. Because there are plenty:
-	Impermanent Loss
-	Inventory risk
-	Out of Range
-	protocol and token exposure

If we can understand what each situation can cost, we can improve the overall portoflio return. 

And here is the focus of the tool I am building: monitoring risk to optimize the performance.

This project was created to bring a more **disciplined, risk-oriented approach** to DeFi strategies, inspired by institutional practices.

## Current focus

- Monitoring lending and borrowing positions (LTV, liquidation buffers)
- Tracking CLMM LP positions:
  - in-range / out-of-range status
  - inventory exposure
  - fee generation
- Following performance over time with a **net PnL approach**
- Understanding portfolio-level exposure across tokens and protocols
