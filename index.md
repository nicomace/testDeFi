ABOUT_Introduction of myself

Overview

My name is Nicolas Macé, I am from Paris and I graduated from y engineering school in 2021. With a combination of passion and expertise on financial markets and blockchain, I aim to bridge the best of these two worlds, with transparent and efficient financial services

tradFi

Over the past 4 years, I have been working in Investment Banking on X assets environment ensuring real-time support and risk monitoring on trading activities on Derivatives, Fixed Income and Forex products.

These experiences thaught me how risk is mitigate in such intensive environment where proactivity, investigation and communication are the keys.



DeFi

For almost 4 years, I have been deepening digital assets and DeFi environment, following evolution of layer 1/2, stacking solutions, DeFi protocols.

After discovering the power of some DeFi protocols such as Aave, offering high-level borrowing solutions for everyone; only available for wealthy people usually; it was clear for me that we are at the beginning of a new financial era where power and control are back to people thanks to decentralization.



what’s here

using my dual experience in tradFi and DeFi, I wanted to apply the institutional rigor I learnt in my professional experiences to my own DeFi activity.

We are now at the heart of my project, creating a DeFi Risk & Performance Monitoring tool that handles the key features required to monitore accurately market making activities.

This is a personal project that represents my passion for crypto with ambition and rigor.

Happy to hear from you what you think
