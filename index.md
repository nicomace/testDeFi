## Presentation

My name is **Nicolas Macé**.

I graduated from an engineering school with a specialization in **financial engineering**, and I worked for several years in **investment banking** in trading support and risk-related roles.

Alongside my professional experience, I have been actively involved in **DeFi and crypto markets**, managing real positions and developing my own monitoring tools to better understand **risk, performance, and exposure**.

---

## Background

### TradFi

- Experience in trading support and post-trade environments  
- Exposure to derivatives, fixed income and FX products  
- Strong focus on **risk monitoring**, incident analysis, and PnL consistency  
- Used to working in time-sensitive, high-stakes environments  

### DeFi

- Active user of DeFi protocols (lending/borrowing, liquidity provision)
- Hands-on experience with **CLMM LP positions**, treated as market making strategies
- Focus on understanding:
  - liquidation risk
  - inventory and range risk
  - protocol and token exposure
- Development of personal dashboards and monitoring tools to track positions over time

---

## Why this project

DeFi provides powerful financial primitives, but **risk is often poorly monitored**.

Most tools focus on:
- APYs
- positions
- token balances  

Very few focus on:
- **downside risk**
- **capital efficiency**
- **net performance after risk**

This project was created to bring a more **disciplined, risk-oriented approach** to DeFi strategies, inspired by institutional practices.

---

## Current focus

- Monitoring lending and borrowing positions (LTV, liquidation buffers)
- Tracking CLMM LP positions:
  - in-range / out-of-range status
  - inventory exposure
  - fee generation
- Following performance over time with a **net PnL approach**
- Understanding portfolio-level exposure across tokens and protocols
