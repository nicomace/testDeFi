## Objective
Liquidity provision is not about chasing APR.
It is about managing inventory risk and extracting fees efficiently.

In [Risk Overview](/testDeFi/project/risk/), returns are estimated with weekly harvest fees. 
As LP are highly dynamic, we can only assume an estimated return. While realized return can be computed when position is closed.

To summarize:
-	Expected return -> decision support
-	Realized return -> performance measurement


## Fee Management Process

</figure>

This layer aims to track all harvested fees. It records fees from active/inactive pools by weeks -> realized fees.

I choose harvest Fees once per week. It makes sense as earnings start to be valuable.

To keep the process simple, we input: Week, Pool and Fees. Then, It is automatically added in the table.
*nb: only active pools and existing weeks are selectable*

All the fees-related data in the Dashboard comes from this layer.


## Performance Measurement Framework

</figure>

To compute the overall realized return, positions must be closed.
Capturing fees from the Fees layer and processing the inventory drift between open / close, we can finally compute the net outcome of this position.

Meanwhile Duration is used to measure the daily performance of the position. 
-> Daily return allows performance comparison across positions with different lifetimes.

This module shows us if the position was sufficiently compensated for the associated risk.


## Why this matters
-	Fees do not compensate poor range management
-	Picking wisely underlying crypto is essential (beware of too much vol)
-	Time matters more than expected APR

**Performance without risk context is noise. This toolkit links both.**
