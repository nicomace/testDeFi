💧 Active DeFi Position Monitoring (CLMM & LP)
•	Tracking of active liquidity positions across Concentrated Liquidity Market Makers (CLMMs)
(e.g. Uniswap v3-style mechanics)
•	Detection of:
o	In-range vs out-of-range status
o	Capital currently productive vs idle
o	Exposure asymmetry between base and quote assets
•	Monitoring of inventory drift, critical for market making strategies
Particularly suited for range-based liquidity provision, delta-sensitive LP, and fee-driven market making.
