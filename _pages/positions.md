💧 Active DeFi Position Monitoring (CLMM & LP)

- Tracking of active liquidity positions across Concentrated Liquidity Market Makers (CLMMs)
(e.g. Uniswap v3-style mechanics)
- Detection of:
- In-range vs out-of-range status
- Capital currently productive vs idle
- Exposure asymmetry between base and quote assets
- Monitoring of inventory drift, critical for market making strategies

Particularly suited for range-based liquidity provision, delta-sensitive LP, and fee-driven market making.
